# How to use the Data Hazards project

<!--Scriberia image here-->

There are four steps to using the Data Hazard labels:
1. **{ref}`Learning<er-datahazardshowtouse-labels>`**: familiarising yourself with the Data Hazard labels.
2. **{ref}`Applying<er-datahazardshowtouse-apply>`**: deciding which Hazard labels are relevant to your project.
3. **{ref}`Reflecting<er-datahazardshowtouse-precautions>`**: on what to do differently and what mitigations to make.
4. **{ref}`Display<er-datahazardshowtouse-display>`**: displaying the labels alongside your work can help you to communicate that you've thought about these broad ethical issues and how you'd like others to use your work.

This spells LARD ðŸ§ˆ, which makes it pretty easy to remember! 
Rest-assured, this project is still suitable for vegans ðŸŒ±.

In addition, whether you have used the labels yet or not, you can also **{ref}`contribute<er-datahazardshowtouse-contribute>`** to the project. If you think any labels are missing or could be improved, this project is looking to evolve with collaboration.

## **1. Learning** about the Data Hazard labels
The first step in using the Data Hazards materials is learning about the Data Hazards labels: familiarising yourself with them so that you can later {ref}`apply<er-datahazardshowtouse-apply>` them to a project.

<!--Different terminologies used: these use terminologies suggested by community members.-->

Data Hazards labels are supposed to represent as broad a selection of ethical risks associated with data-centric work as possible.
This includes, but is not limited to the risks considered by  {ref}`ethics committees<er-committees>`, which often focus on risks to research participants that could lead to legal repercussions for the research organisation, such as [consent](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/lacks-informed-consent.html) and [privacy](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/risk-to-privacy.html).
It also includes issues like [algorithmic bias](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/reinforces-biases.html) or [danger of misuse](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/danger-of-misuse.html) that might result from downstream outputs of research, rather than the research process itself.

Learning about the Data Hazard labels is usually part of a Data Hazards workshop, but you can also do it independently by:
1. Reading [the labels on the website](https://datahazards.com/labels) - click on each of them for more information!
2. Practicing applying them to a project.
3. Talking about them with other people.
4. [Printing out label cards](https://datahazards.com/_downloads/b92f884790471e61048c5e0fee4dd08e/DataHazards_PrintableCards.pdf) and playing games with them.

## **2. Applying** the Data Hazard labels
<!--What it means to apply the labels-->
*Applying* the Data Hazard labels means deciding which labels are relevant to a project.

<!--include flow-chart here?-->
### What projects can I apply the labels to?
<!--which projects applies to-->

We recommend that you apply the labels to your own work unless you've been invited to give feedback on another piece of work.

The labels have been applied to many different types of projects that use data or data-intensive methods.
Some examples of projects that have used Data Hazards include:
- A predictive model that aims to use machine learning to predict human traits from their genetic mutations.
- A digital humanities project that uses web-scraping and natural language processing to analyse text of political speeches.
- An NHS data-linkage project to create a new database for researchers to use.
- A modelling project that aims to improve whole-cell models of a bacteria.

### When should I apply Data Hazards in my work?

Data Hazards labels can be *applied* at any stage in the research life-cycle.
Ideally, the best time to *apply* the labels is close to the beginning of the research project, at the same time as you might consider your {ref}`university ethics process<>`, or {ref}`pre-registering your analysis<>` (you can also pre-register your Data Hazards analysis!). 
However, much of our research builds on itself, so researchers have also found workshops useful to reflect and plan what they can do better in follow-on projects.

<!--LINK TO SUSANA'S PHD LIFECYCLE CASE STUDY-->
Read {ref}`the PhD research life-cycle case study<>` for an example of how applying, reflecting, and displaying labels can fit into a research life-cycle.

### How: Workshop
<!--link to Euan's case study-->
Applying labels through a collaborative and interdisciplinary discussion can give project owners perspectives they might not otherwise consider.



### How: Self reflection
