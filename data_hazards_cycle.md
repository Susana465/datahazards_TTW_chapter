# Data Hazards in the Research life-cycle
To help visualize where and when Data Hazards can be used in your workflow, below we use an example assuming four main stages of workflow: design, data collection, data analysis and reporting.

## Design:
 - Are you using data? Then doing some reflection on [identity and positionality](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-positionality.html?highlight=bias) could help you think of what Data Hazards labels you might encounter as you design your project, for example ["ranks of classifies people hazard"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/ranks-classifies.html) or ["risk to privacy"](https://datahazards.com/contents/hazards/risk-to-privacy.html) could apply at this stage.

 - In this part of the workflow, you might want to prepare to avoid certain Data Hazards if you can, and if you can't avoid them because of where your data has come from, you may want to acknowledge this. For example, if you a [sensitive data project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdp.html), what Data Hazard labels will apply, and/or what can you do to design your project in a way that avoids certain harms?
 
## Data Collection and Analysis:
 - As you are collecting and analyzing your data, you might want to iteratively think of the potential Data Hazards that exist in the information you are collecting. 
 To then apply the labels as you perform the next step of the process: reporting.

## Reporting:
 - When reporting your results, you can think of applying and reporting the Data Hazard labels that are relevant for your project; examples of how others have done this can be found here [link to self reflection and case studie(s)]. 
 Labeling your project with Data Hazards should also include considerations of mitigations to these risks. This would then be helpful for people who see your outputs in the future. They can be aware of potential risks as they proceed with the project, and continue to think of solutions to any issues related to the research topic.
